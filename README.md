# SFML-JSFML-Pong

A very, very simple pong game. Written early 2014 in order to check out the JSFML library, lots of code copied from some other repository which I sadly cannot find on GitHub anymore. The game in both languages is the same game, just translated to JAVA using JSFML. I have been writing in CodeBlocks (C++) and Eclipse (Java). Hopefully this helps someone to understand the JSFML library since there aren't many online repositories using it.
